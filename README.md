# Master-Thesis-Notebooks

Here you can find all the Jupyter Notebooks I used for my master thesis on the topic of neural networks and deep learning.
In the notebooks you can classify fahion images from a Kaggle dataset.

The title of the thesis is: Architectures of neural networks for the classification of clothing: design and implementation of a comparative analysis


## Usage

The easiest way to use the notebooks is in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
When you open the notebook just click on the button [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
